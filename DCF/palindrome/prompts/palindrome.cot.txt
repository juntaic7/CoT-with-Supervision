Determine if the list is a palindrome. The list contains a middle marker '#', which separates the first half and the second half of the list. Think step by step.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'b', '#', 'a', 'b']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': False}.

List: {{list}}
