Reverse the list following the steps below:
     1. Initialize the 'counter' to 0.
     2. For each character in the input list starting from the leftmost character, move it to the rightmost place in the list and increment the counter.
     3. If the counter equals to the length of the input list, this list is reversed.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result', with the reversed list concatenated to a string. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 'dcba'}.
