Determine if the count of '0' in the list is greater than or equal to the count of '1' in the list at each prefix following the step below:
    1. Initialize 'count' to 0.
    2. For each element in the list:
        - If the element is 0: increment 'count' by 1
        - If the element is 1: decrement 'count' by 1
        - Output current 'count'. If 'count' is less than 0, break and return False.
    3. If the final 'count' is 0, return True.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. For example, if the input list is '['0', '0', '1', '1']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': True}.
