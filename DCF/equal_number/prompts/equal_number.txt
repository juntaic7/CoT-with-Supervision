Determine if the count of '0' in the list is greater than or equal to the count of '1' in the list at each prefix.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. For example, if the input list is '['0', '0', '1', '1']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': True}.
