Given a sequence of movements on a cycle of length 5, compute the end position. The movements are STAY, INCREASE, DECREASE and are represented as {0, 1, 2}.
Please determine the agent's final position after executing all movements in the list following the steps:
    1. Convert every movement '2' in the list to -1, '0' to 0, '1' to 1.
    2. Calculate the sum of all elements (which will be 0, 1, or -1) in the list.
    3. The final position is the sum modulo 5.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. Do not output the individual counts. For example, if the input list is '['0', '1', '2', '1']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 1}.
