Please sort the list below in ascending order using insertion sort following the steps below. Note that lower case characters are greater than upper case characters.
    1. Start by creating an empty list 'sorted' for sorted characters.
    2. While the original list is not empty:
        - Remove the first character from the input list
        - Insert the character to the correct place in 'sorted'.
        - Display 'sorted' after each step.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result', with the sorted list concatenated to a string. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'B', 'C', 'd']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 'BCad'}.
