Please convert the list below to odds first following the instructions:
    1. For every letter in the list, decide whether it's at odd position or even position. Output the decisions.
    2. Concatenate all letters at odd positions in the original sequence. 
    3. Concatenate all letters at even positions in the original sequence.
    4. Concatenate the result of Step 2 and Step 3.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result', with the sorted list concatenated to a string. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 'bdac'}.
