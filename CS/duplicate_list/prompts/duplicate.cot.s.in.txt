Please process the input string by duplicating it following the steps:
    1. Initialize a new empty string
    2. Start from the leftmost letter of the input string, add it to the end of the new string until you reached the end of the input string.
    3. Then repeat step 2 until the length has been doubled.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. For example, if the input string is 'ab', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 'abab'}.

Input string: {{string}}
