Please sort the list below in ascending order using insertion sort. Think step by step. Note that lower case characters are greater than upper case characters.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result', with the sorted list concatenated to a string. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'B', 'C', 'd']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 'BCad'}.
